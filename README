** FONet **
A Federated Overlay network based Client-Server architecture. An AccessNode acts as a middleman between client and server. This enables DoS protection via strong client authentication.

Three sub-projects are present here. Client, AccessNode and Server, each in their respective folders. The folder 'common' stores code that is common for all three projects. The 'libs' folder stores archives of the libgcrypt and libgpg-error libraries used in this project.

Security services are offered: Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication. Cryptography operations are performed using the Libgcrypt cryptographic library.
